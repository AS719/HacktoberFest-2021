<h1>Algorithm for Fractional Knapsack Problem</h1>
<h3> By Krishna Priya R</h3>
<p> Steps:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Compute the value per pound Fractional Knapsack Problem for each item.</li>
<li>Obeying a Greedy Strategy, we take as possible of the item with the highest value per pound.</li>
<li>If the supply of that element is exhausted and we can still carry more, we take as much as possible of the element with the next value per pound.</li>
<li>Sorting, the items by value per pound, the greedy algorithm run in O (n log n) time.</li>
</ol>
